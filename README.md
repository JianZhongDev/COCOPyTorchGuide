# COCOPyTorchGuide

Here's a plain language version:

This guide will show you how to set up the COCO dataset for PyTorch, step by step.

This repository also includes a PyTorch COCO dataset class that:
- Downloads only the necessary categories to save storage space.
- Applies identical random transformations to both images and labels.
- Offers various label formatting options.

## Quick Set Up Guide and Demo Notebooks
1. Got to [COCO webiste](https://cocodataset.org/#download) and obtain the url for annotation file.
2. `pip install pycocotools`
3. Use the [PythonDownloadAndUnzip](./PythonDownloadAndUnzip.ipynb) notebook to download and unzip the annotation file.
4. Use the [ExploreCOCOAPI](./ExploreCOCOAPI.ipynb) to have a quick understanding of the key functions provided by the COCO API.
5. The [COCOSegDatasetTest](./COCOSegDatasetTest.ipynb) notebook includes a quick demo on how to use the customized COCO PyTorch dataset provided in this repository.
